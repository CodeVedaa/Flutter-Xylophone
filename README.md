# Flutter Xylophone App

Welcome to the Flutter Xylophone app! 🎶 This project is designed to demonstrate how to create a fun, interactive xylophone app using Flutter and the just_audio package.

## Demo

In the demo video, I showcase the initial setup and functionality of the app, where each key plays a musical note. We also explore how to play entire songs as part of the xylophone experience.
